    "## Extension Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Title: Behaviour of edge signs in economic and non-living entities networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis performed in this [work](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/triads-chi10.pdf) enabled the authors to evaluate the social psychological theories of balance and status in social networks. This work allows us to better understand and predict the signs of relationships in social networks. The theories have been formulated on humans and were tested on them and the [paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/triads-chi10.pdf) tests them on the connections formed by humans on social networking sites. To take this analysis one step further, we would like to observe how well these social theories hold up when the network context has changed. Moreover, we would also like to perceive the similarities and differences in analyzing the signs of relationships between entities created by people instead of the people themselves. For these two cases, we will be using a bitcoin dataset to provide a network in a financial setting (economic context) and a Reddit dataset that presents a graph of subreddits created by users. Our analysis would include observing and also presenting statistics about the number of balanced and unbalanced triads in the data and thereby interpreting the validity of balance and status theory and corroborate or contradicting the claims of the authors made in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extension, we want to verify and discuss the generalization of the balance and status theory on other types of networks. Specifically, we want to answer the following questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whether the proposed theories on balance and status can be extended to `networks created based on monetary/profit relationships` **instead of** of `relationships created as social connections in slashdot data` i.e. will the relations between people (users) still follow the balance and status theory even when there is a direct cash transaction involved?\n",
    "2. Secondly, will the theories of balance and status propagate from the **individual human relations** to the **nonliving entities** that are created and controlled by living entities? Here the graph is formed by the units that are created by humans and signs are based on relations between these units. Thus, we want to verify if the collective behavior of humans in those units follows the same laws as individuals. The datasets in the paper are representative of the direct opinion of one person on the other, unlike the Reddit dataset where the relation is between human-created units (that carry the opinion of humans).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposed datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "For this extension, we are going to use the following two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the first question we use [soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.csv.gz](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html) dataset and use [soc-redditHyperlinks-body.tsv](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html) for the second question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signed network in the bitcoin transaction dataset is created by users trading Bitcoins, who rate other members on a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signed network in the Reddit dataset is the connections between two subreddits (a community on Reddit). Each connection represents the sentiments of one community towards the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Collection and Graph Building\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall use the datasets from the above-provided URLs. As the datasets are already clean, we do not need to any preprocessing and build the graphs directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Undirected Analysis (to evaluate 'balance' theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe the counts of 4 possible signed triads.\n",
    "2. Observe the frequency of triad occurrence with a random distribution of signs in the network.\n",
    "3. Contrast between the original triad frequency and with random distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Directed Analysis (to evaluate 'status' theory predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe the frequency of Contextualized links (clink): It's a triple formed when node A and node B have an edge to or from another node X before A and B form an edge between each other.\n",
    "2. Compute the generative baseline and surprise, receptive baseline, and surprise for each type of clink.\n",
    "3. Using the above-computed metrics, check the consistency with Balance and Status theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Perform analysis on edge reciprocation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe the number of reciprocations for each type of edge that is the first connection being positive or negative and reciprocal connection being negative or positive\n",
    "2. Calculate the probability of reciprocation for each type"

    "3. We go over each node (primary node) of the graph using the upper triangular adjacency matrix (UTAM).\n",
    "4. We get the list of nodes connected to the primary node and create a sub-square matrix from the CSR representation of the UTAM.\n",
    "5. The submatrix contains all the adjacency representation of the nodes all nodes connected to the primary node and each nonzero entry of this submatrix represents a triad.\n",

    "The signed network in the Reddit dataset is the connections between two subreddits (a community on Reddit). Each connection represents the sentiments of one community towards the other in one post. Thus, there will be many connections from one subreddit to another. **We merge all the edges from one subreddit to another and take the majority sign as the sign of the edge between them.** The data is stored in a tsv file with `SOURCE_SUBREDDIT, TARGET_SUBREDDIT, POST_ID, TIMESTAMP, LINK_SENTIMENT, PROPERTIES` as headers. We ignore the POST_ID and PROPERTIES as we deal only with the sign of the edge. The *SOURCE_SUBREDDIT* will be the from node, *TARGET_SUBREDDIT* will be the to node, *LINK_SENTIMENT* which is 1 or -1 will be the edge sign."
